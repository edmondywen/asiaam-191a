            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My first significant memory of maps comes from a children's encyclopedia book which used a stylish 
                map to highlight countries around the world, exposing my mind and imagination to a breadth of cultures
                at a young age. The fact that this memory still sticks with me is a testament to the power of maps as a 
                form of information. I want to use maps to highlight the stories of everyday people who oftentimes do 
                not get a voice at a table. 
            </p>

                <h2>Debate Travel</h2>
                <p>
                    This map features some of the places I've traveled to for high school debate. The color I chose for 
                    each icon reflects the mascot/logo for the school/institution. I traveled mainly for one of two reasons: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>tournaments</li>
                        <li>camps</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <div id="db8map"></div>
            
            <h2>Cooking</h2>
                <p>
                    Making food creates a serotonin rush in my brain. Very cool. Here are some dishes I made recently:
                </p>
