## What social problem is being addressed?
The urban heat island effect in Los Angeles

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
Communities who are disproportionately impacted by the urban heat island effect, namely low-income and communities of color.

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
- Technical
    - How to feasibly phrase our research questions (ex: how do you ask someone how "shady" their neighborhood is) 
    - In order to create a comprehensive analysis of conditions across LA, we would need to cast a wide net and survey a large number of people of all backgrounds   which is quite the task

- Ethical 
    - Privacy: Our study could potentially involve personally identifying information like income, address, and ethnicity
    - Must not minimize people's concerns. There will be some qualitative/subjective input from users regarding their personal situations. We need to properly represent those perspectives
